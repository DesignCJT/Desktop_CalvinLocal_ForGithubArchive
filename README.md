# Desktop_CalvinLocal_ForGithubArchive
Mainly for the website this local repository is to hold projects as archives

This is my first jump into Github Fall/Winter 2018. Working on a collaborative project with 2 others as well as posting
for my own portfolio. 

I began coding again and am loving it! Rather than struggleing like I did in my college Python Intro course, I'm now able to make
sense of more and more! These are my more finished pieces since getting back in the game.

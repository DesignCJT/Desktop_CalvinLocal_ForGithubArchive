Processing is an in depth Java library that is paired with a Processing Editor/IDE
that one can run programs from and automatically changes the Processing library features to Java. 

The editor can be found on the Processing website
https://processing.org/download/

The file can be exported in Java but is hard to recognize and I've yet to understand how to make 
it run once in the exported form. This is project I'll continueally work on but this is also why I've 
switched over to JavaScript using the same foundations p5 library and editor.
